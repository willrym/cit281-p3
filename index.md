## The Good Stuff:
1. Created a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects
2. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, updated the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package
3. The updated "server" file displayed an initial web page with web links to test the "coinage" code
4. The initial web page loaded from a file.
